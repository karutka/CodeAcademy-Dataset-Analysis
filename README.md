# CodeAcademy-Dataset-Analysis
This repository contains a project completed during studies at CodeAcademy.

#### The task was to find and choose an open-source dataset, explore, analyze it, and manipulate data.

For the analysis data of international health, nutrition, and population data collected yearly from 1960-2016 was selected.
Source of selected dataset: https://data.world/data-society/global-health-nutrition-dataÂ¶

With my work, I answered two questions:
* What is the name of the country with the biggest percentage of deaths due to injury in 2012?
* What is the predicted population growth rate in Lithuania in 2070?

To answer the second question, a linear regression model was created.

The task was completed using the Jupyter Notebook environment.
